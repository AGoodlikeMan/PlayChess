## Setting up virtual env
#### For UNIX based devices(linux/mac)
To be able to run the project, you should either be having libraries mentioned in requirnments.txt in your PC(The same version) or you can create your virtual env with all these libraries in few simple steps! (Recommended)<br>

```
$ python -m venv env # where env is name of our virtual environment
$ source env/bin/activate
$ (env) pip install -r requirnments.txt
```
<hr></hr>

#### Windows 
Open windows power shell and change directory to the same as home directory of project (where readme.md is)<br>
Write in the following commands to set up your virtualenv

```
> pip install virtualenv # if virtualenv isn't installed
> virtualenv env # where env is name of virtual env
> env/Scripts/activate
> (env) pip install -r requirnments.txt
```
<strong>NOTE: If you aren't able to activate the environment, you may need to change your execution policy. It's really simple, open powershell as an admin and write the following command -></strong>
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

## Adding a new admin!
There are two ways to add a new admin to website's database!
#### Method 1 (Through the Interactive App): 
<ul>
<li>Go to the home directory (where run.py is) through the terminal and enter the following code</li>
</ul>

```
$ python new_admin.py
```

<ul>
    <li>This will prompt you to type in your desired username and password!</li>
<li><strong>NOTE: </strong>your username can only contain alphanumeric characters and an underscore! Failing to adhere to username restrictions will result in error. However since you're in an interactive app, you will be reprompted to enter yoru username and password!</li>
</ul>

#### Method 2 (Through the Script):
<ul>
    <li>Go to the home directory (where run.py is) thorugh the terminal and enter the following code</li>
</ul>

```
$ python new_admin.py <_ADMIN_USERNAME> <_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
```

<ul>
<li>You can type in your desired username followed by your desired password seperated by a space right in front of the python command!</li>
<li><strong>NOTE: </strong>In case of failure in creating an admin, it will throw an error and abort. It won't go for a reprompt and you'll need to run the command again!</li>
</ul>

## Different routes
<ul>
<li>The default url <strong>http://127.0.0.1:5000/</strong> or <strong>http://localhost:5000/</strong> routes to the site.</li>
<li>Use <strong>http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/</strong> or <strong>http://localhost:5000/admin/</strong> to access the admin interface</li>
<li>Use <strong>http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog/</strong> or 
<strong>http://localhost:5000/blog/</strong> to access the blog interface</li>
<li><strong> NOTE : blog route is under development and encountering bugs is possible if you access the blog application. If you encounter any errors, please exit the application and start again! </strong></li>
</ul>
